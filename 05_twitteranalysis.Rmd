# Big-Data Course: text analysis on Twitter datasets assumed to be from foreign Twitter bots
In this assignment, we want to use R to analyze a large dataset of tweets, just made publicly available, so
there is a real opportunity to make original discoveries. For this reason, the assignment is to write a
“White paper” on your results. An example of such a white paper – albeit much longer than this
assignment!—is this report:
Howard, Philip. N. et al. (2019). The IRA, Social Media and Political Polarization in the United States,
2012-2018. Computational Propaganda Research project, Oxford University.
